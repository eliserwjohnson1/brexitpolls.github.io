			<font size="7"> The referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU has been labelled a "Once in a generation choice” by the Prime Minister. The aim of this website is to provide our readership with unbiased information on which to base a decision on how to vote.<p></p> 
Here you will find facts rather than inflammatory information intended to cause panic. No more scare mongering threats such as if we leave the world will go into recession or if we stay we will lose all independence and just merely a cog in the United States of Europe. The UK citizen has the weight of an important decision on its shoulders and whilst we will be unable to vote for you, we can at least give you an indication of how other people are likely to vote.

						<h3><font size="7">It is a natural reaction for all of us to gravitate to like-minded people, for example people who share the same age or gender.  So are those voters of who share the same age and gender likely to vote the same way as you? Why not put this to the test with our interactive website?  Enter your gender and age group to find out how whether others in are likely to be voting. 
						<p></p>
						The information gathered has highlighted some interesting facts.  For example, those over 65 years plus are most in favour to leave, and also make up a large percentage of the voting population. In the 2015 general election 79% of this group voted.  Whilst 58% of 18-24 year olds -  arguably the part of our population most affected by the effect of leaving the EU - want to remain but only 43% of this group turned out to vote in the 2015 election.

						<h3><font size="7">Although you may support your local MP, perhaps your opinion might be changed if that person voted to remain in or to leave the EU.  Again, use our website to type in your postcode, followed by your constituency to see how your MP is likely to vote.

						In some cases the results can be surprising. For example, Zac Goldsmith is keen to leave the EU but he is running for London Mayor, where the majority of Londoners are in favour of remaining in the EU.
