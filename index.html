						Interestingly people who are 65 years + are most in favour to leave, and the make up a large percentage of the voting population, with 79% of them voting in 2015. 
						While 18-24 year olds, arguably the most affected by the EU referendum as they will be living with the decision for longer, have 58% wanting to remain. However, if the voting patterns remain the same as 2015 and only 43% turnout to vote their voice might be drowned out by the older generations. </font></h3>
